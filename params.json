The problem is that on Wikipedia, people have been lazy for a long time, categorizing on the fly what they THINK their article is about.  The object of this is to take their summary sentence, the first sentence of their article that is supposed to be well thought out and effective and mine the sentence for key words, associate those words to existing categories and select the categories they would like to apply to their article.  Once they've gone through and selected which they'd like to use, they receive basically what they need to copy and paste into their Wikipedia categories. \r\n\r\n\r\nTeam members and roles\r\nSydney: Design, CSS, Conceptualizing\r\nJason: Javascript, Jquery, CSS, HTML (all very masterful)\r\nAnkita: Concept contribution\r\n\r\nTechnologies used\r\nHTML, HTML5, CSS3, CSS, InDesign, Wikipedia API\r\n\r\nLink to demo version\r\nNEED THIS\r\n\r\nKnown bugs\r\nThe project needs a lot of research on the most effective way to get the best results.  Right now, it's not perfectly giving good results.  There would need to be some NLP and in-depth testing. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
